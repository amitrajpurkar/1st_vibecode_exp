## tools used:
1. Windsurf Cascade: ... [AI_Coding_Tools.md](AI_Coding_Tools.md) 
2. Git -- version control; capture changes/ notes every step of the way
3. MkDocs -- documentation is very important.. note it down first; keep refining subsequently
4. Vercel and GitHub Pages -- shareable presentation of summary is also needed 

---

## what i learned so far from my first experiment:
1. plan your work ... [initial plan](prompt_pad.md)
2. break it down into small tasks
3. use  AI to first do a thorough analysis of the codebase... [Analysis of current codebase](First_Analysis.md)
4. **review that analysis yourself**
5. sequence tasks and assign them to the AI one by one
6. incrementally capture successfully compiling code in version-control
7. **at each step, compile code, run tests and ensure they are passing before committing**
8. **do execute the code and see if it runs successfully as well.**
9. at each step, document the changes in markdown files; commit docs as well
10. organize documentation in a way that is easy to navigate and understand; eg mkdocs
11. once desired changes and enhancements are achieved, ask AI to do a thorough code review and document that code review, in terms of issues caught, suggestions for improvements, etc.
12. in my earlier version of code in 2017, github showed code composition as 97% java... in this code its 33% java, 57% HTML (due to markdown files)
13. another observation: **i had been specifying in markdown; and reviewing at each step; and then committing at each step**
14. ... may be more as i learn :)

## Developer Workflow just for this mkdocs site:

### Workflow using GitHub Pages
1. i am using an explicit repo that only has mkdocs files
2. sync up and bring larger markdown files from the main repo; these are the ones worked with Windsurf AI
3. update hand-crafted markdown files as needed
4. build and run the site locally to see if it looks good
5. if needed make changes to the markdown files and repeat steps 2-4
6. when satisfied, commit the changes
7. push the changes to the remote repository

    a. i am next copying the compiled pages from "site" folder to another repo

    b. using a specific repo for GitHub Pages: amitrajpurkar.github.io
    
    c. once i copy over updated pages here, commit and push to that repo

8. GitHub Pages is then updated automatically

```bash
cd mkdocs-repo 
# update hand-crafted markdown files as needed
# sync up and bring larger markdown files from the main repo; these are the ones worked with Windsurf
mkdocs build --clean
mkdocs serve

diff -r site ./../../amitrajpurkar.github.io
cp -r site/* ./../../amitrajpurkar.github.io/

cd ./../../amitrajpurkar.github.io
git status
git add .
git commit -m "updated docs"
git push

# github pages.. need to get this working
# gh pages -b gh-pages

```

Deploying a Python application in Google Cloud can be done using various services like Google App Engine, Google Cloud Run, or Google Kubernetes Engine. Here's a step-by-step guide for deploying a Python application using Google App Engine, which is a popular choice for web applications.

### Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Account
1. **Create a Google Cloud Account**: Sign up for a [Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/).
2. **Create a Google Cloud Project**: In the Google Cloud Console, create a new project.

### Step 2: Install Google Cloud SDK
1. **Install the Google Cloud SDK**: Follow the instructions to [install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2. **Initialize the SDK**: Run `gcloud init` to set up your Google Cloud project.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Application
1. **Create Your Python Application**: Organize your Python code. Ensure that you have a file named `app.yaml` in your project root, which contains configuration settings for your App Engine.

   Example `app.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   runtime: python310  # Use the latest Python version available
   entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:app  # Adjust according to your app setup

   handlers:
   - url: /.*
     script: auto
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Create a `requirements.txt` file to list your dependencies. For example:
   ```
   flask
   gunicorn
   ```

3. **Create your main application file** (e.g., `main.py`):
   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
       return "Hello, World!"

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
   ```

### Step 4: Deploy the Application
1. **Deploy to App Engine**: In the terminal, navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

2. **Access Your Application**: Once the deployment is complete, you can access your application at `https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com`.

### Step 5: Manage and Monitor
- Use the Google Cloud Console to manage and monitor your application. You can check logs, view traffic, and manage resources.

### Additional Considerations
- **Database**: If your application requires a database, consider using Google Cloud Firestore, Cloud SQL, or Datastore.
- **Environment Variables**: You can set environment variables in the `app.yaml` file for sensitive information.
- **Scaling and Traffic Management**: App Engine can automatically scale based on your traffic.

### Conclusion
That's a high-level overview for deploying a Python application on Google Cloud using App Engine. Depending on your application needs, you might explore options like Google Cloud Run or Google Kubernetes Engine for more flexibility.
