# AI Code Assistants

we have many of those around; which one to choose can get tricky; most Code Assistants are close or similar to each other; and its often "developer's-taste" that drives the decision

never the less, due to number of tools around, i would rather place these comparison on a separate page/ markdown

* Codex (OpenAI); 
* Copilot (GitHub); 
* Claude (Anthropic); 
* Cursor AI (Anysphere)
    * AMP CLI (Sourcegraph)
    * Codeium (which i was using for more than a year)
* research also on licensed JetBrains Idea -- this comes with its own AI assistant
* other coding agents: TabNine, CodeWhisperer (AWS), Kira (AWS), Kite, Ghostwriter (Replit), Augment Code...
* most of these tools cost around $20 per month for Pro-licenses

i ended up choosing Windsurf Cascade.. 
* i was trying the free version for more than a year
* got opportunity to use it at work as well
* plus this was offering best monthly price at that moment/ time.
